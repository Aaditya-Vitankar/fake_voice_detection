          ● Deep Fakes are artificial intelligence (AI) generated or transformed materials that
            impersonate as legitimate text, video, image, or audio recordings. In particular
            circumstances, the AI is utilised in order to generate the content fully.
          </br>
          <br>
          ● Recently, technologies manufactured with AI have been developed and that technologies are capable of generating
            voices that are convincing and believable.
          </br>
          <br>
          ● Though these technologies were designed to be helpful, they have also been used maliciously to use audio to broadcast misinformation
            around the world, which has contributed to the dread of the "Deep Fake Voice". 
          </br>
          <br>
          ● Recently nicknamed "audio manipulations' ', audio deepfakes are increasingly available on low-cost
            mobile devices and home computers. As a result, public cybersecurity worries about the
            adverse impacts of AD use have spread throughout the globe.
          </br>
          <br>
          ● People can use it as a logical-access voice spoofing technique, where it can be used to manipulate public opinion for
            propaganda, defamation, or even terrorism.
          </br>
          <br>
          ● Massive amounts of voice recordings are
            broadcast daily over the Internet, and detecting fakeness from them is really a challenging
            task.
          </br>
          <br>
          ● As far as Deepfakes are concerned, there are a number of detection techniques that
          have been implemented to distinguish between fake audio files and real audio files.
        </br>
        <br>
        ● There are many ML and DNN models that use acoustic features to extract high-level
          representations looking at the analysis of differences between to identify real and fake audio.
        </br>
        <br>
        ● Here are some general voice recognition strategies: First each audio clip/voice is pre-
          processed and converted into appropriate audio features for input. These audio features are
          then fed into the voice recognition model. The detection model then performs the required
          operations, including the training process through layers given to the model. 
        </br>
        <br>
        ● The output is fed into a fully connected layer. The output will produce a result that voice is real or fake.
          As a result, Voice detection has become an active field of study with the development of
          cutting-edge technologies and deep learning techniques.
        </br>
        <br>
        ● However, with these advances, current deep learning techniques are facing challenges, and further research is needed to
          determine which areas of voice detection require further development.
