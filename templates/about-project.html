          • We are living in the era of AI revolution, where use of Artificial Intelligence is greatly increased in the field of Software Development and Information Technology, use of AI is not limited to these fields only, it has its own use cases in Entertainment Industry such as Gaming, movies, and many more, and it is also used in the field where the automation is needed.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • But we all know everything has its uses good or bad, similarly AI has also has its good and bad uses, where AI can be used for good, on the other hand it can also be used for bad, or with the intention to harm anyone or their reputation. One such use case of AI is “Deep-Fakes”<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • Deepfakes are synthetic media that have been digitally manipulated to replace one person’s likeness convincingly with that of another.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • Deepfakes are the manipulation of facial appearance or voice likeness through deep generative methods.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • Deepfakes leverage powerful techniques from Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content that can more easily deceive.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            • Many methods of deep learning are used in deepfakes generation like Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) etc.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>• Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their potential use of spreading disinformation, committing financial frauds and many more.</p>
